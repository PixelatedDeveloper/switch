Adding a item to the site is pretty easy by doing a git pull request adding the item to the specific 'yaml' file (underscore data folder) and the image (if you have one) to the images/category/ folder. Look at the other items in the .yaml files to see what the expected format is. If your pull request is approved things will be merged and shown on the website. We can make this site better together! If you don't understand Git or all this tech mumbo-jumbo you can submit your item through a form pretty soon. <br />
